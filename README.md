## Solar Lunar

Created w/ SunCalc, a JS framework for sun and moon positions. It's awesome.  

Visit: https://hannd17.github.io/SolarLunar/ on your phone for a live demo. Add to your homescreen on iOS for a fullscreen experience.

Uses Geolocation to get sunrise, noon and sunset. Sun rises if before noon, sun sets if after noon and then moon rises during the night.  
Auto updates every minute to adjust positions.

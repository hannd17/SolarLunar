## Solar Lunar

Created w/ SunCalc, a JS framework for sun and moon positions. It's awesome.  

Visit: https://hannd17.github.io/SolarLunar/ for a live demo.

Uses Geolocation to get sunrise, noon and sunset. Sun rises if before noon, sun sets if after noon and then moon rises during the night.  
Auto updates every minute to adjust sun position.
